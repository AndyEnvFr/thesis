carsten said that ML is no good for science. This is strongly reduced and he didnt said it like that.
However, his point was that the black-box nature of the ML undermines causalities, hence doesn't contribtue to our understanding.
BUT imagine i want to show if CNDD acts stronger on rare plants, i.e., is stsabilizing: I don't care how CNDD works on rare plants but I care i rare plants show higher CNDD

Now, as I am writing my thesis, I recognize that many theories can not be tested, becuase we lack data e.g., dynamic data of forest plots with many variables.
One way of making variables available for modelling is to approximate them with allometric equations
	If CNDD is known to be mediated by soil pathogens, then it would be good to predict it based on the conspecific fine root mass instead of the basal area maybe
	However, it is really difficult to reach that step where I understand the mechanisms in such detail that I can claim that fine root mass can best predict CNDD, but LM can help there and it might be justifyable:
		BUT: i might not be interested in learning macro-molecular, or more generally, fine scaled mechanisms such that microbial pathogen at species with trait XY correlate strongly with fine-root-mass
			I might just be interested in the most important variable for that specific species that drives CNDD. So while not knowing the fine-scaled mechanism, I still can use the information to understand the broader mechanism that shape biodiversity across latitudes: E.g., CNDD acts stronger in tropics.
		However I see 2 main problem with this
			1)looking at every species seperately gives the advantage of knowing the important variables for CNDD. Yet, I can't use the same variable across all species. This is fatal, if I want to quantify CNDD in a multi-species community. The problem is that while for one species fine-root-biomass might be a good proxy, for my other species it is not
				Therefore, when doing it like HÃ¼lsmann et al 2024 i.e., adding a conspecific and measuring the difference in response, adding one tree is not enough, it must be added all traits that were used for that specific species (e.g. fine root mass)
			2) Is it feasible do ML- detect a set of params that are working fine to predict CNDD in one species?
	If we think that it makes sense to predict CNDD by another variable we could try to estimate that variable based on allometric relationships:
