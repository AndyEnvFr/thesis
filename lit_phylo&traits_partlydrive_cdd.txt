Song et al 2021
note: these studies dont look at the effect of phylogenetic diversity among heterospecifics on CDD but look at the CDD strength across related taxa
Are JC effects phylogen. conserved?
	If so, then phylogenetic relatedness drives CNDD rates in two ways
		1) relatedness in trees implies same defences against pathogens (e.g., shade tolerant trees are less susceptible)
		2) relatedness in plants drives pathogens host-specificity
	the strength these processes take place will shape of conspecificity at which CNDD operates (e.g., species, family, genus)
	But JC effects may vary strongly even across closely related species
Methods
	species as random intercept had best AIC
Results
	mean effect size within each family varied much
	negative effect ≈ positve effect ≈ neutral effect
	species-level effects were not strongly structured within higher clade orders such as genus or family
		adding genus or family as random effect to species didn't improve AIC, hence differences are explained best at species level

Kunstler et al 2016
while it is known that traits are trade offs: fast growth and low wood density, hence, low durability VS slow growth and high wood density, hence, high durabilty
how do 3 traits (wood density, specific leaf area, maximum height) influence competition?

Results
	more different traits had little influence on weakening interspecific competition
		none for leaf area and wood density; little benefit for max height
	trait ~ competition
		higher wood density = higher tolerance against competition
		no correlation between max heihgt and competitive effect
		high SLA had low competitive effect
