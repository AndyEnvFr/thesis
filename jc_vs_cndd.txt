what is the difference between the concept of stabilizing CDD / CNDD and the Janzen-Connell hypothesis?

JC is limited by the fact that it claims higher host-specificity in tropics compared to temperate forests due to a lack of seasonality, while stab CDD can act everywhere
CNDD is tied to one focal species, claiming that its demographic rates are driven by the conspecific density (relatively more then to heterospecific density)

JC
	mediated through limited to seed and seedling mortality by seed and seedling enemies
	the individual performance is given by the
		distance to adult
		density of conspecific seeds or seedlings
stab CDD / CNDD
	we need to differentiate between
		empirically measured CNDD (interested on a density effect at individual level)
			measured on individual level
			is measured by plant traits (e.g., mortality)
			as a function of local CDD and sometimes HDD
		CNDD as stabilizing mechanism (interested on a density effect that acts at individual level but that has a stabilizing function in the light of coexistence theory)
			therefore, CNDD as a stab mechanisms extends the concept of purely empirically measured CNDD, but requires these measures to assess an effect
			measured on population level
			is measured like empirically measured CNDD

	mediated through seed and seedling mortality by respective enemies but also
		resource requirements
		autotoxicity
		other processes
		and they act on dispersal, growth, mortality, and reproduction
	the individuals performance is given by the
		local density of conspecifics
