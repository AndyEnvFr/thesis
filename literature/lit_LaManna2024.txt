LaManna et al. 2024: effect of Consp. density effect on community dynamics and plant diversity

2.1 | Different Viewpoints on Conspecific Density Dependence in Ecology
	(un)stabilizing CNDD: In this framework, stabilizing CDD occurs when increasing conspecific densities reduces species' demographic performance more than increasing heterospecific densities (Hülsmann et al. 2024). In other words, stabilizing CDD is CDD corrected for general (non-species specific) density effects.
	PSF 
		Is = 𝛿11 + 𝛿22 − 𝛿12 − 𝛿21 OR (home - away) OR (Con. - Het.)
		where I_s is the pairwise feedback between two species
		When density is explicit, this is analogous to stabilizing CDD.
		stabilizing CNDD -> + diversity under the assumptions that
			heterospec. DD is equal between all species
			species are equal in all other aspects than CNDD
			homogenous environment
3 | Understanding Local Stabilizing CDD: mechanisms that drive stab CNDD coming from different communities + how does stab CNDD interact with dispersal and plants spatial distribution (this is needed, when determining the landscape scaling of stab CNDD effects)
	we need to understand and account for dispersal and habitat, when predicting how stab CNDD alters plant communities
		dispersal
			typically most seeds fall close to their parents, forming an aggregation of conspecifics AND few seeds are transported far away
			in that aggregation pathogens (with S increasing effects) or mutualists (with S decreasing effects) form faster then in areas where conspec. are sparsely distributed
			for species with high stab CNDD the far away seeds should have higher demographic performance
		abiotic habitat
			also create variation of conspecific densities
		both factors influence, how stab CNDD assembles communities
	Mechanisms of local stabilizing CNDD in subfields / research communities
		host-specific natural enemies and intraspecific competition as mechanisms generating local stabilizing CDD
		However, an emerging consensus is that stabilizing CDD is the net outcome of many types of biotic interactions:
			relative host- specificity of pathogens & mutualists
			allelopathy
			strength of competition against consp. and heterosp.
		PSF
			advantage to separate stab CDD into positive and negative feedbacks and look how each part contributes to the net stab CDD effect
		Spatial pattern
			species with high stab CNDD might show less aggregations
				in old compared to young age classes (as the older aggregations had more time to thin out)
				compared to other species with low stab CNDD
			research on the effect of stab CNDD on aggregations found that stab CNDD weakens aggregations
				they used empirical null models with dispersal kernel
				aggregation with stab CDD was lower compared to this null model
		Dispersal
			stab. CDD favours away recuits, therefore directionally selects traits that cause far dispersal
			Therefore, aggregation will be counteracted by stab CNDD + by directional selection
			fruit/ seed traits can attract a vector that disperses them close/away to/from con-/heterospec.
			Comparisons for future study include how dispersal phenology, distance, and mode (and other dispersal-associated traits) are related to local stabilizing CDD across species
4 | Scaling up Impacts of Local Stabilizing CDD on Communities and Metacommunities
	difficult because
		trees are long living, therefore empirical research is difficult
		there could be other processes that leads to similar pattern (e.g., mass effects and source sink dynamics (May et al 2020) at different spatial and temporal scales
	Processes at large scale can counteract local stab CNDD (e.g., predator satiation)
	landscape stab CDD might be generated at higher scales (e.g., bark beetle responding to host density in landscape scale) without involving local scale
(4.1.1) stab CNDD in the context of modern coexistence theory
	modern coexistence theory is driven by 2 phenomenological (non-mechanistic) processes
		1) interspecific fitness difference (= equalizing mechanisms)
			reduction of intrinsic fitness differences
		2) niche differences (= stabilizing mechanisms)
			species get advantage when rare
		if 2) > 1) coexistence is likely. E.g., when stab. CNDD compensates fitness differences
	Population scale: how does the population growth rate change based on increasing species density
	local scale: how does demographic performance change based on the increase of density of con- relative to heterospecifics
	=> local stab CNDD ≠ NDD at community scale
		E.g., if a rare species is spatially aggregated they have no community wide NDD. However, within their aggregation they can have stab. CNDD
(4.1.2) stab CNDD in the context of resource competition theory
	extends the concept of coexistence theory by adding potential niche differentiations
	natural enemies
	mutualists
	stabilizing if
		intrasp. > intersp. competition
		relative host specificity of natural enemies
	stabilizing CNDD = fosters richness by creating niche differentiation which in turn increase intrasp. competition, all else being equal
(4.2) scaling up local stab CNDD
	many processes can boost or weaken the effects of local stab CNDD when up-scaling it

4.2.1 - 4.2.3 is very specific: variation of stab CNDD within ontology, interaction with interspecific intrinsic fitness differences, pairwise interaction: lumped heterosp. and multispecies systems
	life stage: stab CNDD in one life stage/ demographic rate must not translate into stab CDD in λ, as the different stages can experience also de-stabilizing CDD, resulting in different net effects

4.3 | Spatial and Temporal Variation in Local Stabilizing CDD
	habitat preferences can also result in the appearance of destabilizing CDD (i.e., higher growth/survival in preferred habitats with higher abundances)
	Recent studies have found evidence that CDD becomes more stabilizing in wetter conditions
	plant–soil feedback meta-analyses suggest that feedback is more positive (less stabilizing) with increasing aridity

(not sure where this is from)

spatial patterns:
	An alternative way to evaluate stabilizing CDD is via spatial patterns
		species with high stab CNDD might show less aggregations
			in old compared to young age classes (as the older aggregations had more time to thin out)
			compared to other species with low stab CNDD
		research on the effect of stab CNDD on aggregations found that stab CNDD weakens aggregations
			they used empirical null models with dispersal kernel
			aggregation with stab CDD was lower compared to this null model
		An important challenge with studying spatial patterns expected from stabilizing CDD is disentangling the influence of different mechanisms
			For example, if spatial aggregation of conspecifics is detected, is this due
				to dispersal limitation
				positive biotic interactions
				environmental filtering
				or their interaction?
			Ideally, pattern-based approaches might be paired with local-scale field experiments or surveys to enable researchers to distinguish between alternative mechanisms
			BUT: maybe ML can help determine the cause of the pattern
	local scale -> population and community scale
		(e.g., Chesson's scale transition theory; Chesson 2012; Chesson et al. 2005)
	One outcome of this synthesis is the acknowledgment that theoretical frameworks with different underlying mechanisms often predict similar outcomes at the individual, population, and community levels (Table  1; Chave, Muller-Landau, and Levin  2002)
		Therefore, we advise caution when inferring mechanism from a pattern, and additional predictions should be tested where possible to disentangle alternative mechanisms.
	Dispersal
		Challenge: “Strong local stabilizing CDD should exert strong directional selection for traits that enable greater dispersal distances.
		Solution: Examine the potential for such interplay between dispersal strategies and stabilizing CDD, which has been rarely studied. Interesting comparisons include how dispersal phenology, distance, and mode (and any other dispersal-associated traits) differ across tree species as a function of their local stabilizing CDD.” ([LaManna et al., 2024, p. 19])
			Does this play a role for phylo sim? where traits evolve -> A question could be how the evolving of the trait feeds back to stab CNDD
