Abstract
	Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density” ([Chesson, 2000, p. 343])
		invasion growth rate ?
	coexistence mechanisms function by
		1) equalizing: minimize average fitness difference
			can obliterate stab. mech.
		2) stabilizing: increase negative intrasp. interaction relative to inter- 
			resource partitioning
			freq. dependent predation
			mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in pop D; env. factors in space and time
Intro
	Diversity maintenance
		coexistence of community (fixed set of species with overlapping resource requirements)
			review focuses on this definition
		maintenance of S and evenness over longer periods of time
			needs to consider extinctions, speciation (and infrequent colonizations)
	Species coexistence models
		must refer to a big area so that assumption of closed population is met
		if small area: must consider speciation rate
			However, fixed and unexplained speciation rates are unrealistic and inference is impossible
Stable coexistence
	stable = D of spec shows no long term trends: spec at low D recover
	unstable = spec. has no tendency to recover and is not maintained in the system for long time
	invasibility criterion
		rare species (invader) recovers from rarity in the presence of the rest of the community (residents)
		residents are unaffected by invader because rare
		long-term r_i of the invader OR lrr can be used for quantification of coexistence
			if lrr > 0: invader increases from low density
	LV
		according to LV: if α_ij < α_jj, i can recover from rarity
		in a two species system this translate into: α_22 > α_21 & α_11 > α_12
		However, LV might be biased, as r_i is a linear function of D
			However, in model of nonlinear r_i the definitions for coexistence remain true α_22 > α_21 & α_11 > α_12
				non-linear function are achieved by:  α_ij = ƒ_ij(N_i; N_j)
		LV and its extensions are phenomenological: there is no mechanisms of competition that leads to coexistence
	Trade-offs
		advantages that one species has over the other are offset by compensating disadvantages
		trade offs would make R* between species closer to equality, which wouldn't support coexistence
[1]			lrr = b_i[ (µ_i / b_i) - (µ_s / b_s)]; where
				b_s = rate at which r_s declines, as resources decline in abundance
				µ_s = mean(r_s) with unlimited resources
				=> (µ_s/b_s) = mean fitness of spec. s in its environment
					the species with larger (µ/b) is the winner and has lower R*
					trade offs may lead to similar µ/b values between species
			However, in this model coexistence is not possible as the formula allows only one species to recover from rarity
	Resource partitioning
		lrr = b_i(k_i - k_s) + b_i(1 - ρ) k_s; where
			ks = µ_s/b_s
			ρ = measure of resource overlap of the two species
				if ρ < 1 (= overlap < 100%) the last term "b_i(1 - ρ) k_s" becomes positive for both species. Therefore,
				"b_i(1 - ρ) k_s" is a stabilizing mechanism that offsets inequalities generated by the first term
				NOTE: (α_is / α_ss) = (k_s / k_i) * ρ; if ρ = 1
					if (α_is / α_ss) > 1, coexistence is not possible because intersp. comp > intrasp. comp. However,
					if ρ < 1: partly resource overlap can make up for higher in interspecific competition; coexistence is easier achieved
			"b_i(k_i - k_s)" = average fitness comparison as in [1]
			if stabilizing mechanisms ( "b_i(1 - ρ) k_s" ) > fitness differences ( "b_i(k_i - k_s)" ), coexistence is possible, as both spec experience positive r_i
		Trade Off & model assumptions
			doing well in one resource -> donig less well in another OR 
			density dependent feedback loops with resorce limit resource harvest intra- and intersp.
		limited ρ and trade off -> + intrasp. competition; which eventually leads to stabilization
	In models with diffuse competition (multispecies competition) lrr can be approximated
		lrr ≈ b_i(k_i - mean(k_s)) + { [b_i * (1 - ρ) * D] / [n-1] }; where
			n = number of species in the system
			k_i = fitness of rare / focal spec i
			mean(k_s) = average fitness of residents (competitors of rare species i)
			ρ = niche overlap (not necessarily defined in terms of resource use)
			D = positive constant
			( "b_i(k_i - mean(k_s))" ) = average fitness comparison
				mech involved: eq mech
					in the absence of stab mech, eq mech can at best slow down the rate of competitive exclusion
					in the absence of stab mech, eq mech may enable coexistence
			( "{ [b_i * (1 - ρ) * D] / [n-1] }" ) = stabilizing term
				wihtout this term, all species but the fittest (on average) would be lost
				if this term > Δfitness difference of worst spec, than all spec coexist
				mech involved: stab mech
			in this approximation the n and mean(k_s) are relevant for the success of the invader
	mech with stab and eq properties: how do mech with stab properties arise ???
		here: 	def niche space: resource, predators, time, space
			def niche: is not an Hutchinsonian hypoervolume but is defined by the 
				effect that a species has at each point in niche space 
					e.g., a species consumes resources and has an effect on resource density
					if a species depends most on a particular resource it has a strong reductive effect
				and by the response that a species has to each point
					e.g., if resource density is high, individuals reproduce and grow vigorously
					if a species depends most on a particular resource it has a strong response
			if a species depends most on a particular resource (strong response & strong effect), then it has a density-dependent feedback loop and is limited by it (self-limitation)
			if another species has the same relationship with another resource, then the intrasp. limitation is greater then the intersp. and both species can coexist
				even if the first species uses some of the reousrces of the second or vice versa
				this however, depends on explicit and implicit assumptions
				explicit assumption
					a symmetric situation with equal resource densities and equal species productivity leads to a scenario with only stab mech
					an asymmetry results in the fitness comparison term ≠ 0 ( can be caused by e.g., one resource being much richer, one species being more productive per unit resrouce, one species has lower mortality)
						If the Δ between intrinsic fitness of two species > stab mech, then competitive exclusion occurs
							because if one species dominates, it will steal too much of the resource the second species mostly depends on
				implicit assumption
					species are independently limited
						BUT assumption is violated, if main resources - the ones that spec most depend on - have dynamics independent of consumption by such species
							however, this is not true if the resource is actually the same for e.g.,
								the main resource for two species is the same but in a different life stage
								the main resource "light" for two species is the same just localized differently: canopy or forest floor
						this assumption must be fullfilled to make the claim that if intrasp. > intersp. = coexistence
					there must be a density dependent feedback loop from the species to itself by
						resource feedback loop (resource D decreases) or by
						interference (higher predation rates / pathogen load at higher population D)
	Fluctuation dependent and -independent mech
		independent (i.e., eq mechanisms)
			e.g., resource partitioning, frequency dependent predation
			community dynamics are modelled deterministically with stable eq points
			can function in the presence of environmental fluctuations but fluctuations dont influency population dynamics by and large. Therefore, 
				we can think of fluctuations and eq mechanisms as independent in that the fluctuations dont change the dynamics, indeed,
				some eq mech require such fluctuations -> fluctuation dependent
		dependent
			temporal fluctuations
				relative non-linearity of competition / apparent competition
					r_i is commonly a non-linear function of limiting factors (e.g., resource)
						-> Spec A has higher r_i if the resource is scarce
						-> Spec B has higher r_i if the resource is abundant
					stable coexistence may result from different non-linear responses
					For one limiting factors
						r_i(t) = E_i(t) - φ_i(F); where
						t = fluctuating env. condition
						E_i(t) = maximum r_i as a function of t
						F = limiting factor (e.g., shortage resource: larger F means shortage of resources)
						φ_i(F) = describes response of r_i on F
						the departure (Abweichung) of the function φ_i from a linear function is its nonlinearity, measures by τ
							τ = 0, if φ_i(F) is a linear function
							τ > 0, if φ_i(F) is a type two function
						two species (a,b) with different τ can coexist, if
							"a" with larger τ has a mean fitness advantage in the absence of fluctuations (i.e. stable conditions [?]; if t = 0 E_a(t) > E_a(b) ) and
								"a" dominates mostly, however, causes high amplitudes in resource cycles, therefore when resources get scarce, b can recover from rarity
							"b" experiences lower fluctuations in the limiting factors when it is an invader than when it is a resident
								when "b" is rare, it can benefit from stable resourec availability (lower fluctuations in the limiting factors), allowing it to recover from rarity
							at the same time as "b" recovers, F will regenerate, making "a" the dominant species again
							for coexistence we need r_b when rare > r_a average
							in this case the resident species "a" controls the resource dynamics
					mean(r_i) ≈ b_i(k_i - k_s) - b_i(τ_i - τ_s) * V(F^-i); where
						"b_i(k_i - k_s)" = Δ fitness
						"b_i(τ_i - τ_s)" = relative non-linearity
						"V(F^-i)" = variance of F for i and s
						the species with higher τ (see before: "a") is in disadvantage by fluctuations in the limiting factor, however
						if "a" has higher average fitness both effects can eq
						As V(F^-i) varies, depending which species is the invader, allows the term to act stabilizing
					if rearranging, the differences between stabilizing and equalizing become obvious
					mean(r_i) ≈ {b_i(k_i - k_s) - b_i(τ_i - τ_s) * B} + b_i |τ_i - τ_s| * A; where
						B = mean(V(F^-x)); for each species as invader x = (i,s)
						A = 1/2 * abs(mean(V(F^-s)) - mean(V(F^-i))); assuming spec with smaller τ experiences larger V(F) as invader
						{b_i(k_i - k_s) - b_i(τ_i - τ_s) * B} = eq term: realtive Δ fitness, taking into account limiting resource fluctations with opposite sign for both species
						"b_i |τ_i - τ_s| * A" = is stabilizing term as it has positive sign for both species
						Thus, stabilizing non-linearity (nonzero τ_i - τ_s combined with V(F)) can have both eq and stab role						
 				storage effect
					negative environmental fluctuations -> reduce D, hence competition (however, not comp. exclusion). Instead,
					models with stable coexistence under env. fluctuations translate into models of temporal niches:
						species are distinguished not by the type of resource they use, but by the time they use it
					In general intrasp. competition is strongest, when the focal species is favoured by the env.
					In general intersp. competition is strongest, when the competitive species is favoured by the env.
					storage effect requires 3 mechanisms that play together to achieve that intrasp comp. > intersp. comp.
						1) differential response to the environment
							species "a" is dominant in winter while "b" in summer
						2) cov(r_i ~ env [env. repsonse] ; r_i ~ inter&intrasp comp [competitive response])
							negative env. conditions decrease, positive env. cond. increase competition
						3) buffered population growth
							limits the impact of intersp comp (when a species suffers from env)
							by having life-history traits that allows them to withstand averse conditions
								e.g., seed bank, long adult-hoods, resting eggs in zooplankton, dormacy
						All three mechanisms leads to intrasp. comp > intersp. comp, hence stabilization
	Mechanisms in Combination Integrated over Temporal Scales
		---
	Spatial dimension
		mechanisms
			1) realative interspecific fitness varies in space
				e.g., in a community the species with lowset R* varies, as R* varies itself depending on env. factors -> R* ~ env. factors						
			2) relative variation of dispersal into different habitats
				e.g., marine habitats have complex spawning, currents ... OR because of varying habitat preferences
		The strenght of the spatial storage effect depends on the presistance of hostile hospots:
			1) if environmental differences between localities remain stable with time
				Buffered population growth:
					a population can be divided into different sub-populations in space
					the overall population growth is buffered, as sub-populations experience env. fluctuations differently. E.g., while drought affects one subpopulation, it doesn't for the other
						the strenght of buffering is dependent on an organisms life-history-traits (reproductive rate, life span, dispersal ability)
							e.g., high dispersal allows higher vigility in space, hence higher buffer
				Covariance between Buffer and competition
					coexistence is more likely if favorable env. have more competitions
					happens when env. differences influence competition
						-> hostile environment (stable over time) -> high densities -> high competition
						intrasp. comp > intersp. comp (as spatial distribution decreases intersp. comp. and favorable conditions increase interspecific competition)
			2) if environmental differences between localities constantly change with time
				the spatial storage effect is weak or hardly there, as hostile hotspots can barely develop

Predators, Herbivores, & Pathogens
	predators may add D dependence to their prey pop through
		functional responses
			predator consumption rate changes with prey denisty
		numerical responses
			predator population increases as the prey pop increases
			if prey population is very high, predator might migrate from another area
		developmental responses
			changes in predator life-history traits due to prey availability (e.g., size, growth rate)
	In the absence of such D dependences, a common predator of several prey is a limiting factor such as a limited resource is
		R* -> P*; where the species with lowest P* (i.e., best reproduction/ growth under predation pressure) is the stronger competitor
	If predation is so severe, that it does eliminate competition -> competitive exclusion is replaced by apparent competitive exclusion (mediated by common predator)
	Predators help coexistence
		JC: each prey has its own specialized predator, that holds it down
			stabilizing mechanism, as intrasp. comp. > intersp. comp.
				-> intrasp. comp > intersp. comp == CNDD > HNDD
			The predator is stabilizing, hence allwing coexistence by a feedback loop in which an individuals prey species suppresses its own growth more than a heterospecific does
			This happens if 
				a predator is frequency dependent: generalist predators may have D dependent functional responses, which are stabilizing
				a predator is frequency dependent: multi-generational adaption processes (e.g., parasitoids) may have functional response as well
				a predator is NOT frequency dependent but interacts with another limiting resource:  
			The predator is equalizing, if they predation effect is not density/ frequency dependent
				 its presence is not the main cause for coexistence (e.g., because a resource is), but predators presence can offset Δ fitness
					e.g., spec. "a" and "b" rely on the same resource. "a" outcompetes "b" in r_i per unit of resource, however "a" is also preyed more upon then "b"
