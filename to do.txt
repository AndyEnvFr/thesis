genetisches CNDD: 
	“From the perspective of niche theory, the fitness of individuals might be suppressed more by neighbours with similar traits and/or from closely related species than by neighbours with different traits or from distantly related species (Kraft and Ackerly 2010).” ([May et al., 2020, p. 1080](zotero://select/library/items/WJAAGJCH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F3F5WL33?page=9&annotation=P4SXF5PN))
	“for example, by strong overlap of resource requirements (MacArthur and Levins 1967) or by shared pathogens or herbivores (Freckleton and Lewis 2006)” ([May et al., 2020, p. 1080](zotero://select/library/items/WJAAGJCH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F3F5WL33?page=9&annotation=3CCCYD3W))

spatial patterns:
	An alternative way to evaluate stabilizing CDD is via spatial patterns
		species with high stab CNDD might show less aggregations
			in old compared to young age classes (as the older aggregations had more time to thin out)
			compared to other species with low stab CNDD
		research on the effect of stab CNDD on aggregations found that stab CNDD weakens aggregations
			they used empirical null models with dispersal kernel
			aggregation with stab CDD was lower compared to this null model
		An important challenge with studying spatial patterns expected from stabilizing CDD is disentangling the influence of different mechanisms
			For example, if spatial aggregation of conspecifics is detected, is this due
				to dispersal limitation
				positive biotic interactions
				environmental filtering
				or their interaction?
			Ideally, pattern-based approaches might be paired with local-scale field experiments or surveys to enable researchers to distinguish between alternative mechanisms
			BUT: maybe ML can help determine the cause of the pattern
	local scale -> population and community scale
		(e.g., Chesson's scale transition theory; Chesson 2012; Chesson et al. 2005)
	One outcome of this synthesis is the acknowledgment that theoretical frameworks with different underlying mechanisms often predict similar outcomes at the individual, population, and community levels (Table  1; Chave, Muller-Landau, and Levin  2002)
		Therefore, we advise caution when inferring mechanism from a pattern, and additional predictions should be tested where possible to disentangle alternative mechanisms.
