model
  with fbmr: why dd2 == dd0 in local scenario ? why not in global?
  without fbmr: why dd0 != dd(1,2) in global but dd0 == d(1,2) in local
  why in dd0: local : fbmrOn != fbmr Off but global: fbmrOn == fbmr Off

diagnostic functions
  implemented in R but slow. Implement in c?

questions:
	“not only report local stabilizing or destabilizing CDD but also the possible impacts stabilizing or destabilizing CDD might have on fitness or competitive hierarchies in a community (e.g., Hülsmann et al. 2024).” ([LaManna et al., 2024, p. 17)
		what they mean?

Schroeder paper:
	does it claim CDD ~ N ?
	are mut. more host spec. than pathogens?
	
	
	Phylogeny
		one can look at CDD strength across taxa: binary distinction between con- and het- and checking of one taxa is affected more by CDD
			Song et al 2021
		We want to look at: how does the degree of relatedness affect CDD i.e., break down binary distinction and see how CDD changes along a phylogenetic gradient
