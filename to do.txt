genetisches CNDD: 
	“From the perspective of niche theory, the fitness of individuals might be suppressed more by neighbours with similar traits and/or from closely related species than by neighbours with different traits or from distantly related species (Kraft and Ackerly 2010).” ([May et al., 2020, p. 1080](zotero://select/library/items/WJAAGJCH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F3F5WL33?page=9&annotation=P4SXF5PN))
	“for example, by strong overlap of resource requirements (MacArthur and Levins 1967) or by shared pathogens or herbivores (Freckleton and Lewis 2006)” ([May et al., 2020, p. 1080](zotero://select/library/items/WJAAGJCH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F3F5WL33?page=9&annotation=3CCCYD3W))

spatial patterns:
	An alternative way to evaluate stabilizing CDD is via spatial patterns
		species with high stab CNDD might show less aggregations
			in old compared to young age classes (as the older aggregations had more time to thin out)
			compared to other species with low stab CNDD
		research on the effect of stab CNDD on aggregations found that stab CNDD weakens aggregations
			they used empirical null models with dispersal kernel
			aggregation with stab CDD was lower compared to this null model
		An important challenge with studying spatial patterns expected from stabilizing CDD is disentangling the influence of different mechanisms
			For example, if spatial aggregation of conspecifics is detected, is this due
				to dispersal limitation
				positive biotic interactions
				environmental filtering
				or their interaction?
			Ideally, pattern-based approaches might be paired with local-scale field experiments or surveys to enable researchers to distinguish between alternative mechanisms
			BUT: maybe ML can help determine the cause of the pattern
	local scale -> population and community scale
		(e.g., Chesson's scale transition theory; Chesson 2012; Chesson et al. 2005)
	One outcome of this synthesis is the acknowledgment that theoretical frameworks with different underlying mechanisms often predict similar outcomes at the individual, population, and community levels (Table  1; Chave, Muller-Landau, and Levin  2002)
		Therefore, we advise caution when inferring mechanism from a pattern, and additional predictions should be tested where possible to disentangle alternative mechanisms.
	Dispersal
		Challenge: “Strong local stabilizing CDD should exert strong directional selection for traits that enable greater dispersal distances.
		Solution: Examine the potential for such interplay between dispersal strategies and stabilizing CDD, which has been rarely studied. Interesting comparisons include how dispersal phenology, distance, and mode (and any other dispersal-associated traits) differ across tree species as a function of their local stabilizing CDD.” ([LaManna et al., 2024, p. 19])
			Does this play a role for phylo sim? where traits evolve -> A question could be how the evolving of the trait feeds back to stab CNDD
Other research questions for thesis:
	stab CDD > interspec. fitness differences
		die fitness geht runter in phylosim, wenn traits ähnlich sind, dadurch wird die dichte weniger.
		Während dessen gibt es eine generelle negative Dichteabhängigkeit im Hintergrund
	lumping of heterospecific effects
		“Challenge: Studies using statistical modeling to estimate the performance of individual plants often lump heterospecific effects (Hülsmann et al. 2024), a simplifying assumption used to make calculations more tractable
		when DD differs through phylogen. relatedness, heterosp. effects are not lumped anymore.
		A question can then be: how does strength of DD, that differs between species, yield stab. DD?
questions:
	“not only report local stabilizing or destabilizing CDD but also the possible impacts stabilizing or destabilizing CDD might have on fitness or competitive hierarchies in a community (e.g., Hülsmann et al. 2024).” ([LaManna et al., 2024, p. 17)
		what they mean?
