Vortag Meeting

(Ndd and pdd with global dispersal)

Yenni: how do rare species escape competitive exclusion ?
	this question is still open in the yenni paper
	still, the correlation is surprising (read the paper more detailed)

It was shown that local feedbacks structure diversity patterns, but everything is not well funded
	how does it scale up?
	How to answer this question?

Schroeder: rare and common species may have the same CNDD strength, however, other aspects of the process can be differently (dispersal, persistence ...)
	so it only seems that CNDD is higher but actually isn't

Hypothese: is the dynamic microbe community needed ? Before it was shown that it is (schroder) we test in a simpler model, if it really is needed.
	Or is it possible tot Micic the patterns in a non-coupled model as well?

specificity of mutualist and pathogens legit?
specificity of different across latitudes


Would i expect hat the detection of correlation in PhyloSim is even possible?
