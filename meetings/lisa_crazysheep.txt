meeting lisa crazy sheep

Hypothesen aufbauen auf schroeder und anhand von 4 Metriken testen. I predict that:
	low pathogen specificity, high pathogen dispersal, high mutualist specificity, low mutualist dispersal leads to
		a ___correlation between abundance and CDD___. Even without dynamic microbial feedbacks
		high species richness in the community
		a more even species distribution
		(a stronger CDD effect ?) â€¦ I forgot the last of the 4 metrics
		

How does my Model differ from Phylosim
	no feedbacks possible
		the changed mortality causes changes in the microbe community
		in Phylosim Pathogens and Mutualists are acting implicitly
