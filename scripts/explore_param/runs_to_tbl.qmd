# calculate cdd
this should be a function that return for every cell the identity of neighbours. \\
The simpler method probably results in following cols: \\
focal_ID, focal_status(alive/dead), neighbor_ID, neighbor_identity(con/het) \\
and also should include the exponential decay function:
exp01_N, exp02_N, ... \\
