Hypothesis 2:
    Higher variance in stab CDD (or mortchange) decreases SR
    
tohughts on that:
  I wonder why other studies found that if the variance of stab CDD increases, the coexistence decreases because
  variance of stab CDD == steep correlation (mortchange ~ abund), because we always have negative slopes.
    if the correlation is steep, we observe higher coexistence. We even see this empirically.
      So why should a even steeper correlation mean that coexistence declines?
        Simulation studies explain: if rare species suffer too high from stab CDD, they become extinct. This contradicts Yenni, that says: the steeper
    “In all of the above instances, the role of predation is to generate feedback loops in which an individual prey
    species depresses its own per capita growth rate more than it depresses the per capita growth rates of other species,
    thus meeting the requirements of stabilizing mechanisms. However, when these density-dependent and frequency-dependent
    requirements are not met, a generalist predator may instead have an equalizing role by inflicting greater predation on
    the competitive dominant. If a stablizing mechanism such as resource partitioning is present, then although the predator
    is not the stabilizing agent, stable coexistence may occur in its presence (30).”

      wenn specificity ganz gering ist, kann ich vielleicht keine korrelaiton haben, aber trotzdem hohe SR,
      weil der equalizing mechanism so hoch ist
