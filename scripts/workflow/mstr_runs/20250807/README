implemented exponential kernel for variance in density processes

run_i: strenght(0, .5, 1); var(20, 5, 1); 50*50; 260k generations
run_ii: same but with 1/3 base mortality hard coded

TODO
- i need to test the estiamtes of MC of ndd and pdd
- do the same thing species wise
- dont do the meta-for regression, as Lisa is sceptical
