expKrnl&McCoef.qmd
    here I firstly use the expoenential kernel and calculate the mortality change coefficient
    
expKrnl&McCoefFbmr3000.qmd
    I increased the fbmr, this increases the estaimtes of MC in both directions, because less deaths are frequency independent

fexpKrnl&McCoef_reducedBaseMort.qmd"
    Additionally to the increased fbmr, i decreased the mortality per generation. This further increases MC in both directions, because a higher share of deaths is driven by fitness, instead of cells dying repeatedly

"ExcludeNegativeEqFr.qmd" 
    here, i apply a greater filter, because yenni 2017 excludes ephemeral species for correction
    
"NeutralOnly.qmd"
    I want to test, whether the correlation (metaregression) is always negative even in neutral scenarios and if I have some errors
    therefore, i redo the analysis from scratch
    Also, I randomize the con and mortNextGen params. This should give a slope 0 line, like HÃ¼lsmann et al.
  
"CensusWiseN"
    Here, I dont do a species wise model for the whole generation, but I do a model for group_by(species,census)
    I.e., if a species exists in two censii, i do two models and check correaltion between MC and abundance for two different abundances
    
"NcenFiltRan"
    keep the 250 filter and group_by(specId, census) %>% glm %>% lm(mc ~ abund per cen)
    randomize con and mortNextGen
