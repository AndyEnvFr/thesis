2 Calculating neighborhood densities
  weight by distance within a radius (age not possible in phylosim)
    caution: diagonal bias
    option: linear function or exponential function
      To assess which shape parameters of the exponential decay function are most appropriate for the data set, we fit models with multiple combinations of decay function values and compare models using log likelihood.
  2.3 Data format explanation
    probably I need to give each tree a unique ID and decrease the census interval to be able to compare the same tree at different neighborhoods
    Do I need species code, when phylogeny already accounts for similarities?
    census number is needed for the statistical model
