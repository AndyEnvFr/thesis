Meeting with Lisa

Schroeder paper:
	does it claim CDD ~ N ?
	are mut. more host spec. than pathogens?
	
Phylosim:
	do some runs and check how outputs behave
	for each output create a model summary
	
	Phylogeny
		one can look at CDD strength across taxa: binary distinction between con- and het- and checking of one taxa is affected more by CDD
			Song et al 2021
		We want to look at: how does the degree of relatedness affect CDD i.e., break down binary distinction and see how CDD changes along a phylogenetic gradient

			Webb et al 2006

open questions
	dd = 1.5 ? dd = 1 ? dd = 2 dd = 0 ? does this make a difference? how can we set the dd ?
	maybe through fbmr ? 
	but fbmr â‰  dd (?)

	how does Richness behaves across dd ? plots

implement diagnostic functions and plot functions

	mort change with N
		for run_x in dd = (0:2, by = .5)
		mort with 0 N = int ; run_x; baseline model
		mort with 1 N = int + slope[x1] * density = 1; run_x; density model
		mortchange[runx] = mort0N[runx] - mort1N[runx]

	diversity: species richness per time

	gird.expand(dd, fmbr) |> plot(dd ~ SR) lines(dd ~ change in mort)
