Zhu et al 2015: this is what we want to model
Intro
	Binary het-con. might not be appropriate, as a study showed different HNDD dependent on the neighbor species
	neighbors that are more closely related, have stronger impact on focal species survival
	if the impact of hetsp. relatedness on the survival of the focal species varies much, this might suggest that cndd depends on phylogenetic distance and that phylogenetic distance shapes the spatial patterns that ultimately arise
Results
	The phylogenetic distance had an impact on survival but the strength and direction depended on life stages
	survival of juveniles and adults were significantly negative impacted by closely related neighbours (i.e., >= 5cm DBH)
	with increasing dbh, the closely related hets had a stronger negative impact
	however, on seedling survival closely related neighbours had a positive effect
		An explanation could be that related species also share the same habitat preferences
		while consistent with some studies, this is not consistent to others. A possible explanation could be that phylogenetic niche preservation differs among locations

Notes
	this study does not account for dispersal or habitat preferences, which could also cause observed survival patterns
